# CLD - LAB06 : Infrastructure-as-code and configuration management - Terraform, Ansible and Gitlab
**Group S : A. David, T. Van Hove**

**Date : 01.06.2023**

**Teacher : Prof. Marcel Graf**

**Assistant : RÃ©mi Poulard**

In this lab, we are going to deploy a website running in the cloud and using Terraform and Ansible, tools that use the principle of infrastructure as code. We'll be using NGINX and Google Cloud technologies.

In the first part of this lab, we're going to provision the cloud infrastructure. In other words, we'll create the necessary resources on the cloud.

In the second part, we'll configure the virtual machine by installing a web server and configuration files. To do this, we'll use Ansible.

In the third part, which is optional, we'll use Terraform as a team. The solution will be to store the state of Terraform in a version control system.

# Task 1: Install Terraform

We installed the Terraform application in a Ubuntu 22.04 system based on WSL and did not encounter any difficulties. The following screenshot shows the version of terraform we used:

# Task 2: Create a cloud infrastructure on Google Compute Engine with Terraform



The project-IDs :

- **labgce-388319** For Anthony account
- **labgce-388413** For Tim account



Firs, we added the variables values in the terraform.tfvar file. Then we initialized terraform:

![](figures/Task2_Terraform_Init.png)

Then, we created a terraform plan:

Finally, we validated the plan:

> Explain what the files created by Terraform are used for.



> Where is the Terraform state saved? Imagine you are working in a team  and the other team members want to use Terraform, too, to manage the  cloud infrastructure. Do you see any problems with this? Explain.



> What happens if you reapply the configuration (1) without changing `main.tf` (2) with a change in `main.tf`? Do you see any changes in Terraform's output? Why? Can you think of  exemples where Terraform needs to delete parts of the infrastructure to  be able to reconfigure it?



> Explain what you would need to do to manage multiple instances.



> Take a screenshot of the Google Cloud Console showing your Google Compute instance and put it in the report.
