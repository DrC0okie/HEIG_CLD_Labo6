# CLD - LAB05 : Kubernetes
**Group S : A. David, T. Van Hove**

**Date : 01.06.2023**

**Teacher : Prof. Marcel Graf**

**Assistant : RÃ©mi Poulard**

In this lab, we're going to deploy a website running in the cloud and using tools that adhere to the principle of infrastructure as code. We'll be using NGINX and Google Cloud technologies.

In the first part of this lab, we're going to provision the cloud infrastructure. In other words, we'll create the necessary resources on the cloud.

In the second part, we'll configure the virtual machine by installing a web server and configuration files. To do this, we'll use Ansible.

In the third part, which is optional, we'll use Terraform as a team. The solution will be to store the state of Terraform in a version control system.
